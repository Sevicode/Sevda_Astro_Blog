## Introduction

I finally decided to leave my comfort zone of using MaterialUI with React and give ShadCN a go! I was already familiar with Tailwind CSS and pretty much liked it, so I thought it would be great to be able to use it in my React projects without the need to write lots of code for styling.

When I started reading the ShadCN UI documentation, the first question which came into my mind was:

> _What’s the difference between ShadCN and MaterialUI? Why are we making things complicated?!_

In this short article, I am going to answer this question and also talk about my experience with ShadCN, so bear with me to the end!

## What is ShadCN UI?

ShadCN UI is a component-based toolkit for styling web applications. All you need to do is add a pre-built component to your project and customize it to your liking. The fact that you don’t have to build each component from scratch makes ShadCN UI pretty awesome!

## How do you customize a ShadCN UI component?

To customize a ShadCN UI component, we use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first styling framework. Tailwind allows us to apply predefined classes directly in our code (component), eliminating the need to write lengthy CSS in separate stylesheets.

ShadCN UI handles the heavy lifting by providing pre-designed components, while Tailwind CSS offers the flexibility to make them truly your own. Together, they simplify development and let you focus on creating great user experiences.

## What makes ShadCN UI different from Material UI?

When I first started learning about ShadCN UI, I was confused. At first glance, it seemed similar to Material UI since both are component-based. I wondered why anyone would switch from Material UI, with its rich library of components and well-documented, straightforward usage, to ShadCN UI.

However, they are very different. Let me break it down for you, both theoretically and practically. I’ll start with the boring theory part (but I promise to keep it short!):

### 1- Design Philosophy

ShadCN UI focuses on modular, flexible, and accessible components built on top of Tailwind CSS. In contrast, Material UI implements Google’s Material Design guidelines.

### 2- Styling Approach

ShadCN UI uses Tailwind CSS for styling, whereas Material UI relies on a CSS-in-JS approach using libraries like styled-components or Emotion (its default).

### 3- Component Library

ShadCN UI provides simpler components, giving developers more freedom to customize them. Material UI, on the other hand, offers a comprehensive library of feature-rich components, making it ideal for projects requiring complex, prebuilt functionality.
