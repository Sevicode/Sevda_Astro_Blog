## Introduction

I finally decided to leave my comfort zone of using MaterialUI with React and give ShadCN a go! I was already familiar with Tailwind CSS and pretty much liked it, so I thought it would be great to be able to use it in my React projects without the need to write lots of code for styling.

When I started reading the ShadCN UI documentation, the first question which came into my mind was:

> _What’s the difference between ShadCN and MaterialUI? Why are we making things complicated?!_

In this short article, I am going to answer this question and also talk about my experience with ShadCN, so bear with me to the end!

## What is ShadCN UI?

ShadCN UI is a component-based toolkit for styling web applications. All you need to do is add a pre-built component to your project and customize it to your liking. The fact that you don’t have to build each component from scratch makes ShadCN UI pretty awesome!

## How do you customize a ShadCN UI component?

To customize a ShadCN UI component, we use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first styling framework. Tailwind allows us to apply predefined classes directly in our code (component), eliminating the need to write lengthy CSS in separate stylesheets.

ShadCN UI handles the heavy lifting by providing pre-designed components, while Tailwind CSS offers the flexibility to make them truly your own. Together, they simplify development and let you focus on creating great user experiences.

## What makes ShadCN UI different from Material UI?

When I first started learning about ShadCN UI, I was confused. At first glance, it seemed similar to Material UI since both are component-based. I wondered why anyone would switch from Material UI, with its rich library of components and well-documented, straightforward usage, to ShadCN UI.

However, they are very different. Let me break it down for you, both theoretically and practically. I’ll start with the boring theory part (but I promise to keep it short!):

#### 1- Design Philosophy

ShadCN UI focuses on modular, flexible, and accessible components built on top of Tailwind CSS. In contrast, Material UI implements Google’s Material Design guidelines.

#### 2- Styling Approach

ShadCN UI uses Tailwind CSS for styling, whereas Material UI relies on a CSS-in-JS approach using libraries like styled-components or Emotion (its default).

#### 3- Component Library

ShadCN UI provides simpler components, giving developers more freedom to customize them. Material UI, on the other hand, offers a comprehensive library of feature-rich components, making it ideal for projects requiring complex, prebuilt functionality.

#### 4- Learning Curve

ShadCN UI requires familiarity with Tailwind CSS (and honestly, is there anyone who doesn’t know Tailwind these days?!). Material UI, however, may take time to master, especially if you need deep customization using its theming system.

#### 5- Community and Ecosystem

**ShadCN UI** is relatively new and has a smaller community. However, it leverages the well-established and rapidly growing Tailwind CSS ecosystem. Material UI has been around for years, boasting a large, active community, extensive documentation, examples, and third-party integrations.

## Practical demonstration of a Button Styled with ShadCN UI and MaterialUI

### 1- Practical Demonstration of ShadCN UI Button Component:

As you see in this code The button is styled entirely with Tailwind CSS utility classes. You have control over every aspect of the design (e.g., colors, padding, border-radius). Unlike MaterialUI, there are no predefined variants or themes — you build and customize everything.

```
import React from "react";

const ShadCNButton = () => {
  return (
    <button
      className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
      onClick={() => alert("ShadCN UI Button Clicked!")}
    >
      ShadCN UI Button
    </button>
  );
};

export default ShadCNButton;

```

### 2- Practical Demonstration of MaterialUI Button Component:

Material UI’s Button component comes with multiple variants and predefined color options (like primary and secondary). Inline styles or the sx prop can be used for further customization.

```
import React from "react";
import Button from "@mui/material/Button";

const MaterialUIButton = () => {
  return (
    <Button
      variant="contained" // Options: "text", "outlined", or "contained"
      color="primary"     // Built-in colors: "primary", "secondary", etc.
      onClick={() => alert("Material UI Button Clicked!")}
      sx={{
        backgroundColor: "#1976d2", // Custom background color
        "&:hover": {
          backgroundColor: "#1565c0", // Hover state color
        },
        padding: "10px 20px",       // Custom padding
        borderRadius: "8px",        // Rounded corners
        fontWeight: "bold",         // Bold text
      }}
    >
      Material UI Button
    </Button>
  );
};

export default MaterialUIButton;
```

#### What convinced me to start using ShadCN UI?

For me, the most compelling feature of ShadCN UI is that it’s not a heavy library but a toolkit. This means you don’t have to install a large, bulky library to use pre-built components. Instead, you add components to your application as needed.

#### Would I choose ShadCN UI over Material UI?

Yes and No!

The answer to this question depends on two factors:

1- how large is the application?

2- how quickly do you need to build it?

MaterialUI is best for large, enterprise-grade applications with complex design requirements. It accelerates development by providing a polished and comprehensive set of components. However, ShadCN UI is best for medium to small-scale projects or custom designs with a focus on speed and flexibility. In the end, the choice depends on the unique needs of your project.

## conclusion

Stepping out of my Material UI comfort zone and exploring ShadCN UI turned out to be an exciting journey. It challenged my assumptions and introduced me to a new way of integrating Tailwind CSS with React. While Material UI remains a fantastic choice for large-scale, complex projects, ShadCN UI offers a refreshing simplicity and flexibility that’s perfect for smaller or more custom-focused applications.

If you’re already familiar with Tailwind CSS and want to build lightweight, highly customizable React applications, ShadCN UI might just be what you’re looking for. On the other hand, if you need an extensive, feature-rich component library with minimal setup, Material UI will still be your best friend.

For me, I’m glad I gave ShadCN UI a chance — it’s added another powerful tool to my developer’s toolkit!
