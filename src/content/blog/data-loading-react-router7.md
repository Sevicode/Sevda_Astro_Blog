## Introduction

React Router v7 was officially released on 22 November 2024 and brings powerful new features to simplify routing in your React applications.

One of its standout features is its data loading capabilities which helps you fetch and manage data seamlessly.

In this guide, I’ll show you how to effectively load data using React Router 7’s new features, with practical examples that even the ones who are new to React and react routing can follow.

## The Basics of Data Loading

When building modern and complex web apps (or any web app that requires fetching data!), fetching the right data is very important for a smooth user experience.

React Router 7 allows you to couple data fetching with route definitions, through its loader functions. Think of loaders as your data-fetching assistants that work behind the scenes before a route renders.

## Key Concepts in React Router 7 Data Loading

**1- Loaders:** These are functions you define in your route configuration to fetch data before rendering a route:

```
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
  useLoaderData,
} from 'react-router-dom';

const fetchUserData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user');
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user data');
  return response.json();
};

const UserPage = () => {
  const data = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {data.name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/user',
    element: <UserPage />,
    loader: fetchUserData,
  },
]);

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

The `fetchUserData` function fetches user data from an API.
The `loader` key in the route configuration ensures the data is fetched before rendering the UserPage component.
Once you’ve set up a loader, accessing the data in your component is straightforward using the useLoaderData hook. In our example the useLoaderData hook is used to access the loaded data within the UserPage component.
