## Introduction

React Router v7 was officially released on 22 November 2024 and brings powerful new features to simplify routing in your React applications.

One of its standout features is its data loading capabilities which helps you fetch and manage data seamlessly.

In this guide, I’ll show you how to effectively load data using React Router 7’s new features, with practical examples that even the ones who are new to React and react routing can follow.

## The Basics of Data Loading

When building modern and complex web apps (or any web app that requires fetching data!), fetching the right data is very important for a smooth user experience.

React Router 7 allows you to couple data fetching with route definitions, through its loader functions. Think of loaders as your data-fetching assistants that work behind the scenes before a route renders.

## Key Concepts in React Router 7 Data Loading

**1- Loaders:** These are functions you define in your route configuration to fetch data before rendering a route:

```
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
  useLoaderData,
} from 'react-router-dom';

const fetchUserData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user');
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user data');
  return response.json();
};

const UserPage = () => {
  const data = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {data.name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/user',
    element: <UserPage />,
    loader: fetchUserData,
  },
]);

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

- The `fetchUserData` function fetches user data from an API.
- The `loader` key in the route configuration ensures the data is fetched before rendering the `UserPage` component.

* Once you’ve set up a `loader`, accessing the data in your component is straightforward using the `useLoaderData` hook. In our example the `useLoaderData` hook is used to access the loaded data within the `UserPage` component.

**3- Error Handling:** React Router 7 allows you to define error elements for routes, making it easy to handle failures.

This ensures users see a friendly message if the data fetch fails.

```
const ErrorPage = () => <div>Oops! Something went wrong.</div>;

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/user',
    element: <UserPage />,
    loader: fetchUserData,
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
  },
]);
```

**2- Deferred Data:** React Router 7 allows you to load data in parallel using the defer function. This is particularly useful when you have multiple data fetching operations. For example, for a large dataset you would want to defer non-critical data loading.

```
import { defer, useLoaderData } from 'react-router-dom';

const fetchCriticalData = async () => fetch('/api/critical').then((res) => res.json());
const fetchNonCriticalData = async () => fetch('/api/non-critical').then((res) => res.json());

const loader = () => defer({
  critical: fetchCriticalData(),
  nonCritical: fetchNonCriticalData(),
});

const Page = () => {
  const data = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Critical Data: {data.critical}</h1>
      <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading non-critical data...</div>}>
        <div>Non-Critical Data: {data.nonCritical}</div>
      </React.Suspense>
    </div>
  );
};

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/page',
    element: <Page />,
    loader,
  },
]);
```

## Best Practices for Data Loading

1. **Keep Loaders Focused:** Each loader should fetch only the data needed for its specific route. This helps maintain clean, maintainable code and optimal performance.
2. **Error Handling:** Always provide fallback UI for errors
3. **Optimize Performance:** Use deferred loading for non-critical data.
4. **Stay DRY:** Reuse loader functions wherever possible.
5. **Test Your Routes:** Ensure data fetching logic works in different scenarios, like offline mode or slow networks.

## Conclusion

React Router 7’s data loading features provide a clean, efficient way to manage data fetching in your React applications. By following these best practices and examples, you’ll be well on your way to building more responsive and user-friendly applications.
